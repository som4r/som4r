### Simple and Open Middleware for Robotics

A middleware that shares resources (sensors, actuators and services) of one or more robots through the TCP/IP network, providing greater efficiency in the development of software applications for robotics.

Preliminary experiments:

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed middleware, SOM4R, we present preliminary experiments with the developed applications.
