### Simple and Open Middleware for Robotics

A middleware that shares resources (sensors, actuators and services) of one or more robots through the TCP/IP network, providing greater efficiency in the development of software applications for robotics.

Preliminary experiments:

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed middleware, SOM4R, we present preliminary experiments with the developed applications, built specifically for an autonomous wheeled mobile robot, by integrating voice command functionality, obstacle avoidance, greeting a person, battery recharge, and remote control of the vehicle movement.
